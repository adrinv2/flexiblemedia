# First Aim

## About the Space Archive

The first project I introduced for my IST was an image project (for my Image class). It consisted of coming up with a social movement of the future and we had to create visuals for it, recording its existence.

The social movement I came up with was reflecting on an event that took place with the CNT right before the end of the Spanish Civil War, in which CNT material was sent in crates quickly to Amsterdam to be protected. It was archived there years later, after the Second World War, and remains there at lack of resources and space to maintain it by part of the CNT. However, now the IISG archive faces the issue that they are running out of space to keep all their material. Does this put this collection at risk? The historical presence of the CNT during the Civil War is already at risk in Spain as a lot of material was destroyed under Franco's rule.

What I came up with for my assignment was the idea of a Space Archive. That is, that in a state of emergency like that of the CNT during the Spanish Civil War, this foundation would archive the material, creating multiple copies in different mediums and sending some of this material/copies to an archive situated in space.

This group would go by the name of "Tutela". The name originates directly from the latin "tutela" which means guardianship, protection. "Tutelage" means _protection of or authority over someone or something; guardianship_; I predicted that in the future the protection of cultural and historical material would be a basic human right, to prevent the extinction of records of groups and civilizations. This organisation would work separate to any other governments, remaining neutral and unbiased. They would work underground, keeping everything as undercover as they could.


**✦ Who is Tutela?**

Tutela is a group of people who stand for archiving as a means to protect sensitive material (of politically opposing ideals to a certain group that puts them in a position of danger. (Eg: censoring/persecuting government, war, …). They are backed up by a legal code that protects the cultural and historical record to avoid the extinction of their existence.

Material is archived and transcoded into multiple mediums as a way to protect the longevity the material. Tutela has an active lab, discovering new ways of transcoding and preservation. After it is transcoded, copies of it are sent out to the Space Archive, where they are protected and maintained.


**✦ Why space?**
- _Privacy laws_ are ever changing, and with the growth of technology intimacy and privacy disappear. To keep a certain level of privacy, it would have to be external to Earth, where different laws apply.

- _Protection of sensitive material_ is key to this social movement. The more withdrawn from danger and forces that could intervene, the safer it is.  


**✦ Outcomes**

1. _Primary desired outcome:_ An interactive space through which users can navigate and learn about.
2. _Back up outcome:_ Still images and video clips to create a montage of the space archive.
